# clothes-from-code
Auto generate cool code based clothing.

## Requires

This depends on jpglitch and pygments.

## Samples

So far we've made samples for the [gen.py generating its self](https://www.cowcow.com/self-generated-glitch-art-dress_p163262528?2855124) and [kubicorn's reconciler](https://www.cowcow.com/kubicorn-reconciler-go-glitch-art-dress_p163262529?2855124). I may post more in the [glitch code cowcow store](https://www.cowcow.com/artist/holdensglitchcode?2855124).

## Development

Much of the development was live-streamed because "why not?" and you can look watch it at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUbgxMqp27U

## How to use

Run gen.py and provide an input file then take the output to [cowcow](https://www.cowcow.com?2855124) and upload the individual image components.
