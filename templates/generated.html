  <body>
    <p>We are now (very very slowly) generating your dress, {{dress_name}}, based on the code at {{ code_url }} :)</p>

    <p>Here is what is going on:</p>
    {% for row in rows %}
    <p>{{ row }}</p>
    {% endfor %}
    <p>And the dress is done (or we crashed)! Go <a href="https://www.cowcow.com/artist/holdensglitchcode?2855124&sort=2">checkout the store</a>. Your
      <a href="https://www.cowcow.com/shop//{{dress_name | urlencode }}?2855124&store=holdensglitchcodedress"> should have a name {{dress_name}}</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But sometimes the names get a bit messed up in which case <a href="https://www.cowcow.com/artist/holdensglitchcode?2855124&sort=2">you should be able to find your dress in this list</a>.
